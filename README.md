# Popular Movies 2

Stage 2: 14 Oct 16

Popular Movies 2 is an app that has been generated as part of the [Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801?v=ad1). Following the guides this App connects to TheMovieDB.org and downloads popular and top rated movies; the app displays posters, images, release date etc. When online the app will allow you to view the displayed trailers or movie reviews, using apps outside of this one.

If you want to download into Android Studio and run this App you will need an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

## Story So Far
This is my second attempt at the App, the first version did not pass review, various reasons, screen not restoring after rotation, fixed this by using [CursorLoaders] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/CursorLoader.html), database calls on UI thread, fixed this by using [AsyncQueryHandlers] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncQueryHandler.html) and crashed after the user rapidly pressed a movie image 10 times, got round this by storing the context in a variable in the [onAttach] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#onAttach(android.app.Activity)) method. Done away with some of the Material design patterns (AppBarLayout, CollapsingToolbar) I found that added a lot of work, in the App and in my head! CursorLoaders were causing me issues during development, added a SyncAdapter and this helped, but came with its own issues.
